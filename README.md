##Assignment 2

Hi Guys:

Unfortunately I've had to take to the road as part of my job (consulting) and
wasn't able to make it class or spend much time on homework.

This version of my homework2 assignment accomplishes the following:

* implements the add and remove guest functions
* implements tab toggling on submit
* uses angular controllers and services, as well as the ng-repeat tag for listing guests
* displays updated localStorage after each add


#Here's how to run it:

* bower install
* npm install
* gulp
* Then open a browser and go to http://localhost:8080/


#Known Problems
* When you add a user and click submit, the new tab is displayed but you have to click refresh to see your addition.
