##Assignment 2

Hi Guys:

Unfortunately I've had to take to the road as part of my job (consulting) and
wasn't able to make it class or spend much time on homework.

This version of my homework2 assignment implements the add and remove functions, and the tab toggling.  It uses angular controllers and services, as well as the ng-repeat tag for listing guests.  That's all I was able to do.

This assignment is also available here:

Thanks, and Happy Holidays!
